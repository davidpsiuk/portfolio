**Title:** *Emotion Recognition with EEG Data: Leveraging Pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks*  

**Abstract:**  
Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a key area in brain‚Äì
computer interfaces with valuable applications in domains such as mental health and clinical
diagnostics. To address the challenge of limited data availability in EEG-based emotion
recognition, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pretrained on image data can be leveraged
by transforming EEG signals into two-dimensional spectrograms using the Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT). However, existing literature lacks a systematic comparison of preprocessing
methods, feature representations, and CNN adaptation strategies, leaving open questions
about best practices in this domain. This study addresses these gaps by systematically
evaluating multiple EEG preprocessing configurations and comparing two types of 2D
representations: spectrograms and stacked spectrograms, the latter of which has not yet been
explored in the context of emotion recognition. The evaluation framework includes four
pretrained CNN architectures (MobileNetV2, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121) and
compares two approaches to leveraging these models: transfer learning through fine-tuning
and feature extraction with an external SVM classifier. All experiments were conducted on the
SEED dataset, which contains EEG recordings labeled with positive, neutral, and negative
emotional states. The results show that the identified preprocessing configurations
substantially improved validation accuracy. While stacked spectrograms demonstrated
potential for capturing multichannel EEG dynamics, they were ultimately outperformed by
individual spectrograms due to reduced training data availability. Feature extraction
surpassed transfer learning in both validation accuracy and computational efficiency. The best
overall performance was achieved using InceptionV3 and DenseNet121 in combination with
an SVM classifier, reaching a competitive average validation accuracy of 86.67%, and
significantly outperforming a baseline SVM model trained on traditional PSD features. The
findings offer valuable guidance for future work on EEG-based emotion recognition,
highlighting the effectiveness of feature extraction with pretrained CNNs and demonstrating
the value of adapting visual deep learning models to neurophysiological data..
